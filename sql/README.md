# SQL Folder – A/B Testing & Policy Impact Analytics

This folder contains SQL scripts for this project.

Files:

- `schema.sql` – defines the table `ab_test_results` with columns:
  `user_id`, `variant`, `device`, `region`, `date`, `converted`.
- `queries.sql` (to be added) – useful analysis queries for:
  - overall conversion rate,
  - conversion by variant (A vs B),
  - conversion by device and region.
